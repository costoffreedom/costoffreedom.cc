I decided 2 years ago to leave jobs in the media to go learning how to
make cheese. I saw this as a step towards essential freedom.

Beyond choosing a life much more in touch with nature and craft, it
would give me the freedom to carry around with me the ability to
eventually fit with a concrete valuable knowledge into communities
that aim at producing their own means of subsistence as much as
possible, maybe creating my own means of subsistence in the end. It
represented a step which would make it possible for me to build a life
outside both the mainstream work system and the food system. I see
both of those systems as freedom down-takers. My statement was more or
less "I want to create something I would be proud of with my bare
hands in a settled place, which would help to tend to freedom for me
and a small community I choose. If not, I feel like I m neutral in the
best case scenario in a path to global freedom, feeding a mass system
which deprives it in the worst way of looking at it"

This vision, of freedom linked with self-sufficiency in food supplies
and self-determination in terms of human organisation, is commonly
shared, at least as an ideal goal, but is also seen as quite extreme
in terms of the changes it requires for most people's ways of
living. Making a step towards it was a way to challenge my own
motivation, my own limits in relation to this fantasized ideal of
real, deep, freedom and its connection with a rural life.

In order to learn properly, I had to deal amongst other things with
the traditional farming work culture as an employee, a reality which
was further from the concept of freedom than I had experienced in all
other work situations, in terms of hierarchy, of hour-based deadline
pressure, of physical commitment. I didnâ€™t fit in but I still had to
learn, and earning money in the process also was quite essential.

You see your friends obtaining more freedom and self-realisations by
more classical means. Mainly by just mastering their work field little
by little, you see them having little by little better salaries, wider
responsibilities, recognition and range of action in what they are
doing. Then you start to wonder why you have to make it so
complicated... I questioned my choices. Of course, making cheese does
not provide the same kind of freedom I was after when I decided on
this change of life, but it still gives the comfort and confidence I
might need for any future achievement.

In the end, setting a precise, high goal of freedom as a core
preoccupation in my life as a starting point hasn't led me to more
actual freedom (yet), but it obliges me to ask myself very often what
is that I'm doing and why am I doing it.  Answering those questions
makes the commitment deeper and slowly creates the connections I need
to live a life closer to my ideals, like a vow I made that forces me
to be brave when I feel insecure about what I am doing, and making it
silly to worry about where I am going to keep those three pieces of
furniture for a while.
