Like a teenager discovering the shortcomings of the father, 21st
Century humans want to break free from a paternalist system that
cannot address complexity. They start looking after each other and
invent new associative institutions for solidarity, and take the
responsibility for their own future without waiting for the next false
promise to come true. In the dying liberal system, the promise of
personal growth and individual freedom is considered the key to a
successful life and-or entrepreneurship. In this context, however,
individual freedom is often understood as the capacity to do anything
you like without responsibility. In the upcoming social
re-organization, stability is grounded on free, voluntary association,
and a new concept of freedom is necessary to keep the system from
running out of control. We must acknowledge that with freedom comes
responsibility. If "with power comes great responsibility", political
power brings the most responsibility, therefore it must respect
individual freedom in the first place.

The antagonistic contradiction between global and individual freedoms
brings on the notion of choice and responsibility to create the
balance and resolve it at another level of reality. Gaining power is
not anymore a question of taking it, but to accept responsibility at a
global scale. Not only to accumulate knowledge but to learn to be
human, and learn to live together. The pathway to a different
socio-political organization starts with the deconstruction of the
fundamentals of our civilization: individual freedom is most
interesting in all aspects when it is measured with regard to the
social constraints, it then becomes productive of worthy social and
collective outcomes. Each individual can then root her personal
development both in a local and global community, therefore reflecting
personal action to nurture both the personal and the
collective. Interdependence enabling self-determination can activate
personal freedom as a responsible asset. A severe impeachment to
self-determination is paternalism, a principal regulator of our
infantilizing civilization. It can be retraced up and until liberalism
and must disappear from a different organizational model if we are to
achieve global individual and responsible freedom, responding to the
injunction to "think global, act local".

Free culture is all about addressing this contradiction as it emerges
from this polarized tension. It produces the actual means and
technical tools both inspired by those issues and created to resolve
them. But free culture was born in reaction to the impeachment of
self-determination and it struggles to blossom beyond resentment. As
it rejects the paternalism of established institutions, it is harder
for free culture organizations to benefit from the synergies of
interdependence that could enable it to become a tangible way out of
dying social structures. It rises the essential question of scale of
organisazion, on which contributions here above express diverging
opinions.

A recurrent pattern in free culture and free software is the lack of
means to achieve stated goals, that ends up limiting the scope of
action. Proponents of scaling up to big entities, as well as
proponents of small, resistant networks need to overcome their
differences: both approaches present opportunities and caveats, both
are complementary. Large entities have easier access to capital, and
can unfold economies of scale, as long as their action is focused and
directed. But that comes at the price of slowness and a lack of
resilience. On the contrary, distributed networks must offset the
costs of their autonomy and their speed in line with a lack of funding
that can be paralyzing.

Large entities are more likely to obtain public grants, as they can
invest in the time and skills required to write acceptable
applications. It involves technical and administrative knowledge and
know-how that is often lacking in existing solidarity networks. But
such grants generally allocate funds to tightly focused projects,
serving specialized tasks and positions. Meanwhile small networks are
often divergent, exploratory, involving multiple skills from a variety
of disciplines: this work cannot be covered by grants which impose
accountable production plans.

The question of how to enable complementarity between larger
institutions and more informal networks is one of balance between
power and agency. Public and corporate institutions naturally exercise
power, given their scale and position within the interdependent
networks of global society. But existing solidarity structures and
systems enable concrete actions within the communities themselves,
often out of reach of formal institutions. Not only the free culture
movements need to help and enable each other, institutional powers
also need to accept letting go of their trouble children, and enabling
decentralized informal networks to intensify their social ties beyond
specialization and a predetermined reading grid. Only then can we end
infantilization and become adults as a species: by cooperating
responsibly as members of a global society that embraces life, in all
its complexity, uncertainty, and affectivity.
