I am alive. I am grateful to be alive. I smile. I want to share this
happiness. With anyone. I may lean on the left side of politics, and
you may lean on the right side. It doesn't show on your face when I
meet you in the street. We smile to each other. We exchange a
salute. We start talking. During the course of the conversation, you
hint to me of your political leaning. I frown. You hold your
words. I'm sorry: the radical in me took over the human for a
moment. I'd like to continue the conversation, why not? But I can't
find my words. A second of silence and we're already out of sync. I
have a doubt. Something in my past prevents me from connecting to
you. Something in your past prevents you from connecting with me. We
depart from each other. Both of us suffer a pinch of sadness.

I am alive. I am grateful to be alive. I smile. I want to share this
happiness. With anyone. I may lean on the left side of the political
spectrum, and you may lean on the right side. It doesn't show on your
face when I meet you in the street. We smile to each other. We
exchange a salute. We start talking. During the course of the
conversation, you hint to me of your political leaning. I frown. You
hold your words.  "Oh," I shrug, "our paths may diverge on this topic,
but I'm grateful we can share this moment together and learn from a
different perspective."  A second of silence, and you smile.  "Let's
walk together," you propose.

I smile back at you. Something in my past was triggered, I felt it in
my heart. Something in your past let you leave the difference
behind. As we let go, we enjoy our internal freedom.

A glance, a smile, a recognition: beyond the imposed categories of
society, we allow each other to not discriminate based on
prejudice. Where is the matter that makes this possible?  I want to
call this matter: freedom.
