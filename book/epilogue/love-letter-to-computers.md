An old WordPress installation turns into a zombie spam machine.

Interesting energy growing a beast of some sort.

Deleted accounts exist as active memories.

Transformative experience produces deceptive results.

Installed open-source software, took me three days: it never worked.

Technologies of intellect: learning to write, learning to write code,
learning to write code and text.

Humans stuck in batches in traffic while information circulates around
them.

Rivers, crabs and free fear on the PA. Inter-dependencies and
versioning problems.

Aging commitments to unclear values.

Seeking something to recycle in the social data wasteland.

Pain-relievers and arnica for the back of your neck.

Vanishing values of approaching deadlines.
