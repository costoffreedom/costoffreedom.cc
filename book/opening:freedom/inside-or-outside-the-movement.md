Working in the free knowledge movement may mean working in a space
that is better fitted to contemporary technology, but it also means
working against several dominant themes in contemporary society and
regulation. Most of our societies prize fences, whether through
copyright or patent or contract or just simple withholding of
secrets. Investors prefer fences, and universities reward them too. As
a result, working in free knowledge is often a fundamentally
transgressive act, politically and economically. And transgression
against dominant social concepts comes with so many different costs.

There's a cost to explain free knowledge, because it has to start with
what’s wrong with closed knowledge. That comes at a cost of having
friends or family understand the job, with questions like “why do you
keep working on this when you could make so much more money somewhere
else?” There’s a cost to always being the outlier in a “normal” room
of professionals, working against the gravity that defines normal for
everyone else. There's a cost in constantly looking for funding when
the dominant capital systems don’t reward or pay for freedom. There's
a cost in always feeling weird, always feeling like the power systems
want you to lose.

It’s not unlike being in a startup religion, except there’s actually
evidence for the benefits of free knowledge.

There’s also a cost within the movement, one we don’t talk about
much. When we do actually all get together, and for once we’re not
transgressing against the “rest of the people in the room,” we have a
nasty habit of judging each other, fighting each other over details
that the rest of the world doesn’t even recognize. I’ve been guilty of
this in the past. It’s just so wonderful to be able to debate our work
with others who agree with us that it’s easy to get into the details,
and all the passion we bring to changing the dominant social system
suddenly is focused on those who we agree with the most.

This isn’t an unusual cost. In fact, it’s one of the most common costs
of any social change movement. But it’s the highest one, for me. The
only advice I have is: we’re in this together, those of us who care
enough, those of us who see enough. It’s easy to take that passion and
turn it against ourselves, but that’s a target that only helps the
closed knowledge system maintain itself.

I’ve worked on recognizing that all of us, from the most strident
backers of the public domain to those who embrace non-commercial
licenses, from a total open commons to a network of managed commons,
have way too much in common to subscribe to a purge mentality within
free knowledge. I’m a lot less strict about applying definitions of
freedom to people - those definitions are for knowledge objects! And
I'm a lot more inclusive of different opinions within the free
knowledge movement than I used to be. It means that at least I'm no
longer paying the cost within the movement, and I’m reserving all the
resources for the costs outside the movement.
