In *Open is not a License*[^1] Adam Hyde has described openness as ‘a set of
values by which you live…a way of life, or perhaps a way of growing, an often
painful path where we challenge our own value system against itself.’

To my mind, openness is also contradictory. I don’t mean contradictory in terms
of the polar dichotomy of open vs. closed, or the endless debates that seek to
define the semantics of open. I mean contradictory on a more personal level;
openness raises contradictions within ourselves. Openness can lead us to
question our position in the world; our position in relation to real and
perceived boundaries imposed from without and carefully constructed from
within.

In one way or another I have worked in the open education space for a decade
now. I have contributed to open standards, created open educational resources,
developed open policy, written open books,[^2] participated in open knowledge
initiatives, facilitated open events, I endeavour to be an ‘open practitioner’,
I run a blog called Open World.[^3] However, I am not by nature a very open
person; my inclination is always to remain closed. I have had to learn openness
and I’m not sure I’m very good at it yet. It’s a continual learning experience.
Openness is a process that requires practice and perseverance. (Though
sometimes circumstances leave us with little choice, sometimes it’s open or
nothing.)

And of course, there is a cost; openness requires a little courage. When we
step, or are pushed, outside our boundaries and institutions, it’s easy to feel
disoriented and insecure. The open world can be a challenging and unsettling
place and it’s easy to understand the impulse to withdraw, to seek the security
of the familiar.

When large scale open education funding programmes first started to appear,
(what an impossible luxury that seems like now), they were met with more than a
little scepticism. When a major OER funding initiative was launched in the UK
in 2009,[^4] the initial response was incredulity.[^5] Surely projects weren’t
expected to share their resource with everyone? Surely UK Higher Education
resources should only be shared with other UK Higher Education institutions? It
took patience and persistence to convince colleagues that yes, open really did
mean open, open for everyone everywhere, not just open for a select few. One
perceptive colleague at the time described this attitude as ‘the agoraphobia of
openness’.[^6]

Although open licences and open educational resources are more familiar
concepts now, there is still a degree of reticence. An undercurrent of anxiety
persists that discourages us from sharing our educational resources, and
reusing resources shared by others. There is a fear that by opening up our
resources and our practice, we will also open ourselves up to criticism, that
we will be judged and found wanting. Imposter syndrome is a real thing; even
experienced teachers may fail to recognise their own work as being genuinely
innovative and creative. At the same time, openness can invoke a fear of loss;
loss of control, loss of agency, and in some cases even loss of livelihood.
Viewed through this lens, the distinction between openness and exposure blurs.

But despite these costs and contradictions, I do believe there is inherently
personal and public value in openness. I believe there is huge creative
potential in openness and I believe we have a moral and ethical responsibility
to open access to publicly funded educational resources. Yes, there are costs,
but they are far outweighed by the benefits of open. Open education practice
and open educational resources have the potential to expand access to
education, widen participation, and create new opportunities while at the same
time supporting social inclusion, and creating a culture of collaboration and
sharing. There are other more intangible, though no less important, benefits of
open. Focusing on simple cost-benefit analysis models neglects the creative,
fun and serendipitous aspects of openness and, ultimately, this is what keeps
us learning.

In the domain of knowledge representation, the Open World Assumption ‘codifies
the informal notion that in general no single agent or observer has complete
knowledge’[^7]. It’s a useful assumption to bear in mind; our knowledge will
never be complete, what better motivation to keep learning? But the Open World
of my blog title doesn’t come from the domain of knowledge representation; it
comes from the Scottish poet Kenneth White[^8], Chair of 20th Century Poetics
at Paris-Sorbonne, 1983-1996, and a writer for whom openness is an enduring and
inspiring theme. White is also the founder of the International Institute of
Geopoetics[^9], which is ‘concerned, fundamentally, with a relationship to the
earth and with the opening of a world’[^10]. In the words of White:

no art can touch it; the mind can only

<span style="margin-left:2em">try to become attuned to it</span>

to become quiet, and space itself out, to

<span style="margin-left:2em">become open and still, unworlded</span>[^11]
