Let’s say freedom is a commodity not a dichotomy.

Therefore when considering the cost of freedom, I am inclined to
compare use and exchange value. How does one quantify either? It’s so
very abstract.
<br>Is freedom useless? No. Freedom fulfills the human need to
differentiate – to ascertain
<br>what makes someone or something different.
<br>Can one exchange freedom for something else?  Yes, often for
convenience, privacy, health, or safety.
<br>Freedom is not either/or, it’s an absurd both/and of exchange and
use value.
<p>At this moment Bassel Khartabil is disappeared for communicating
his views on freedom of expression and has been forced to exchange his
freedom of mobility in addition to many other human rights. I stand
with the #FREEBASSEL campaign in demanding Bassel Khartabil’s location
information and immediate release.
