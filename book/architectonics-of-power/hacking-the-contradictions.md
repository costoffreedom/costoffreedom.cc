Contrary to most people's belief, contradictions are an interesting
and powerful tool for the thinking process. They are something we
often encounter in our minds. For some people, contradictions are the
ultimate roadblock, whereas for others they are a just a stage of
their reflection.
<br>The latter group, when realizing they are stuck with an insoluble
confrontation, find the strength to make a sidestep in order to move
forward.

With a twist, a bounce, an awkward move, they are able to overtake the
contradiction, to hack it and go beyond.

We are at the edge of a critical moment where aporia are not only
rhetorical, but contradictions are systemic.

Having a close look at the digital media fields, we find those
contradictions at the core issues of contemporary productions such as
art, critical design, literature, code, technology, philosophy,
economy...

Most of them are seeking for disruptive technology, social innovation,
philosophical renewal: they can be called a sidestep.

Maybe freedom of thought, to make and move, appears when we are able
to make a sidestep
<br>Maybe freedom is just the possibility to take a sidestep
<br>Maybe freedom means the power for the people to stay in control of
their dreams despite the reality of the system
<br>Maybe freedom is the way we ethically manage internal and external
contradictions to go beyond.
