Hong Kong — Wednesday, 22 May 2016 — *Cost of Freedom: A Collective Inquiry* is a book demanding freedom for Bassel Khartabil and introspect the costs of participation in free knowledge movements. The book was written in Pourrières, France from November 2nd to 6th, 2015, with contributions from 45 free knowledge activists around the world, including Creative Commons founder and former U.S. presidential candidate Lawrence Lessig and Khartabil's spouse, Noura Ghazi Safadi, and uncle, Faraj Rifait.

Today the book is available in electronic and print formats for reading, downloading, sharing, and purchase at <http://costoffreedom.cc>. The entire book is dedicated to the public domain with the "CC Zero" license (CC0-1.0).

Bassel Khartabil is a free knowledge and human rights activist who has been detained in Syria since 15 March 2012, and missing since 3 October 2015. A glboal #FREEBASSEL movement ranging from Amnesty International to the Wikimedia Foundation has steadfastly called for Khartabil's release.

*Cost of Freedom* builds its case for the cost and value of free and open knowledge through essays on the pains and relevance of free culture in the real world and personal reflections on the life, contributions, and costs paid by Khartabil.

&#35;NEWPALMYRA director Barry Threw said [made up quote, real TK] "Our work builds on Bassel's creativity and demands his release. My essay and others in *Cost of Freedom* illustrates Bassels' impact at a personal level and what motivates us."

&#35;FREEBASSEL activist Jon Phillips said [made up quote, real TK] "Today Bassel is 35. We demand the best birthday present for him, his birthright, freedom! Read and share *Cost of Freedom*. Ask #WhereIsBassel? Demand #FREEBASSEL."

*Cost of Freedom* is one of many creative efforts inspired by Khartabil and demanding his freedom. The #FREEBASSEL movement has been covered by *The Guardian* [list of most impressive venues TK]. More information is available at <http://freebassel.org/>.
