# Back to the caverns to surge forward

We can not free ourselves from language and its representations. Software and other technologies attempt to recreate new languages, to express realities that can not be told. 

Uniting hundreds of contributors into a single project requires a common language. In open-source and free software, it is usually something like C or Python or whatever works best to solve the actual technological problem. Then, what happens when half of the people don't write  or read Python ? What happen when another half have zero understanding of how ancient romans temples were built ? What will be the common language then ? Art ? But can an art initiative really be developed like a software project ?

To some extent, the practive of free software is an access to some new forms of literacy. It starts with code itself but that find a continuation in tools, styles and ways of writing in an environment of multiple stakeholders.

Freedom comes as a price of learning it. 
Learning a new language and commit to use it. 
Gaining new spaces to move in, new horizons to explore. Then, also losing space to join others, getting further from what someone still called the "proprietary world".

Yes, this enclave of people that wants to be free have forgot how they get there. 
They forgot how they could question words as big as "freedom" and "costs" ?
When you learn a new language, you lose another one. 

Synapsis,  brains between a word and a reality are here to stay until we die. Language is the structure of our reality.

Like Bassel, once he was used to this new language, he could not resolve to bring back the meaningless. 

Language keep us enslaved more than any other things.

We can not escape the world of our words. We can just add to it : new languages, new meanings, we improve the framework of our understanding. 

Thot gave the writing to Pharaon that saw it as a threat. Humans will rely on the writing instead of their own memories. Who still remember the memory theater of the ancient greeks ?

The cost od integrating the world of 'free software' is to acquire this language. When you acquire it, you start having all those communication problems with the rest of the world. Someone say to you "software" and you understand "free and open-source software". Someone say "movie"  and you just think that you could download and watch it. Someone say "writing" and you just don't know if he is tlking about writing code or writing in a newspaper. Maybe it is writing code in a newspaper. 


Words are traitors. They won't help you, never. You have to help yoursalf. They tie so deeply in yourself that they become your vision of the world. You stop using it and they start use you.


This book was written in Pourrières on 1th to 8th of Novembrer 2015.
It all happens because I got this phone call from a friend asking me for some help to free their friend Bassel from fake Syrian jail.

Just jumped in the project instantly, starting to put together team, webpages, sending emails and calls so everything can actually happen. 
An intense rush to make things real, bring support to help friends in danger, and provide an answer to this call to create some love in the face of the present situation of Bassel, Syria and our world.

I had actually lurking for the last years on a opportunity to put my skills, network and resources at work for something meaningful that can finally link up two sides of my daily concerns. One being an almost academic question of : how can I provide a meaningful contribution to the understanding of computer code as a continuation of history of writing and ? The other one being more a constat of my everyday life experience : what can be done to bring some justice to this world. 

This was firstly about bringing people together and join strengths.  How can I integrate my fascination for languages, history and literature to all this machinic code I write everyday ? How can my friends from the free software world develop a common discussion with people studying literacy in the 16th century ?




The #NEWPALMYRA project and Protocultural series have been a first attempt to answer this question.

ProtoCultural  events to support the encounter of archaeological exploration of art with recent digital practices. It gathers scientists, artists and geeks to develop new forms of artistic and technological expressions based on historical art materials.

ProtoCultural is a moving space to prototype a continuation of thousands of years of human history expressed in all existing art forms.

ProtoCultural considers computer coding as a continuation of human writing history. It takes advantage of all intellectual technologies to push forward the borders of emotions, literacy and understanding of life.

ProtoCultural is an attempt to span art, science, and technology with brains, bare hands and the help of some technology.
