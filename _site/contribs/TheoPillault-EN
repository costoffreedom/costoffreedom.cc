We practice journalism since we are in age of working. However after more than 15 years of reports and interviews, we still not able to call it a job, because his cost has beenso high.

High for our lives, precarious and submitted to media that don't even deserve our attention. High for the profession itself, which we happen to sometimes soil with doubtful deontological hygien or - even worse - mimetism. 

Behind humanist articles, altruist reports or militant photo series, there is hidden realities which embrace all shades of bad faith and dirtyness. 

However, very few socities can pretend to emancipate themselves without a free information system, where journalists stands at the frontlines.

Today, we still haven't find a satisfying setup to provide for the production and diffusion of a chemically pure information. Purified from political, institutionals or personnals stakes.

Share our analysis, dissidencies or images in free information frameworks are the last victories of the small media people, quickly disappearing.

Because there is no cost for journalism. Just a debt to honor.

Until our specificities eventually echo, from newsrooms to media schools, and beyond that, in all societies willing to free themselves.

« Don't be ashamed of wanting the moon, we need it ! » Jean-Paul Sartre.
