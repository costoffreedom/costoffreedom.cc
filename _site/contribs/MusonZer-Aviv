Freedom of information, much like freedom of markets, doesn’t “naturally” lead to the kind of freedom we hope for in society. In fact in the past decade since the rise of the free culture movement we’ve seen many costs like time, attention and education shifting to the side of content creators while financial profit is centralized by the data-hording internet giants that enjoy the reputation of information liberators. Google for example is considered a great patron for free culture while in practice it cannibalizes on the free culture that it monetizes, offsetting the costs of culture from those consuming it and profiting from it to those creating it, and that's us.

The technological principal that powers digital freedom of  information and that we celebrate through free culture and the creative explosion of the web is the same same technological principal that powers digital surveillance. We have to stop seeing these technological principals as “ready-made for culture” whether it be as a pre-made model for cultural exchange, or as a pre-made model for the end of privacy. This techno-determinism is a double edge sword, it’s time to wake up from it and realize that the new possibilities and challenges posed by digital networks should  inform the way we decide to live our lives, not dictate it.
