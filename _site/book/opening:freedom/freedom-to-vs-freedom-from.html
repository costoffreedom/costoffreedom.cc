        <h2 class="center">"Freedom To" vs. "Freedom From"</h2>
        <p>Unlike Bassel Khartabil, the cost to me, personally, of my
free-knowledge work has been cheap. I have not paid with my
freedom. In fact, I have been incredibly privileged to have conducted
my work in creating free and open systems for the dissemination of
scholarly knowledge in a geographical space (the UK and the British
university) and political time that for the most part actually rewards
such undertakings. If I say there is a cost, I feel it is a difference
almost of type by comparison, rather than of degree, with respect to
the price that Bassel has already paid.</p>

<p>But there is still some way to go, even in my privileged world. For
the most part, academics are assessed on their publication record in a
recognised disciplinary space, publishing with known proprietary
publishers. There are very few positions available for the practical
implementation of change in the academy (praxis). This is so to the
extent that Kathleen Fitzpatrick, a fully tenured professor in the
States, quit her post to work on publishing initiatives at the Modern
Languages Association. Fitzpatrick wrote: “This is of course not to
say that one can’t change the world from inside the protections of
tenure. But I do think that those protections often encourage a
certain kind of caution, certainly in the process of obtaining them,
and frequently continuing long after, that works against the kinds of
calculated risk that a chance like this requires.”</p>

<p>Even in my own academic publishing, though, there is a double
bind. Many of my colleagues continue to find (or at least believe)
themselves torn between publishing openly and having a career in the
university. Dissemination and assessment find themselves in conflict
because proprietary publishers own most of the venues for academic
dissemination. And hiring panels look for the books published by the
brands whose quality-control procedures they trust. But if those
procedures and trusted systems are owned by entities whose business
models depend on selling commissioned copies, then despite the fact
that academics can give away their work (because they have a salary)
this knowledge will remain imprisoned.</p>

<p>Even worse, this coercion (as I see it) to publish in known brand and
usually-proprietary venues as a proxy for hiring in the university is
defended as academic freedom (the freedom to choose to publish where
one wants, rather than being told to publish openly). Certainly, it’s
done by “soft power” and a reputational/symbolic economy, but I did
not feel free when I had to publish my first book with a commercial
press. I’m still grateful to them because I needed the book for my
job. They did good work on it and I can’t fault the people who helped
me there. But few people can actually read that book now because it is
so expensive. I signed away the copyright as the price for a job. In
an ideal world, I would have published this openly.</p>

<p>So, even as individuals (such as Bassel) fight for their true personal
freedom that was taken away because they developed open-source
software and facilitated freedom of expression, people around me
continue to claim that it should be their right to lock knowledge away
and that this is a freedom for them (see Cary Nelson’s article in
Inside Higher Ed. for an example). I do not think it should
be. Academic freedom in its real and proper definitional sense is
important (the right to speak truth to power) but we should not demean
it by saying that it is about one’s right to lock knowledge away from
those who cannot pay.</p>

<p>When I say things like this, I am told I am anarchistic, that I want
to destroy tradition, and that I am somehow an enemy of quality in
academia. I have also been told that this coercive soft-power
structure of proprietary publishing doesn’t even exist (usually by
people who haven’t tried to get an academic job in the last
decade). It does exist, and I am not trying to destroy academic
publishing. I am trying to make academia and academic publishing the
altruistic spaces of knowledge-sharing that they should be. As
academics, giving people worldwide the freedom to read our work should
always take precedence over our personal benefit from publishing in
closed venues. I have not always been able to negotiate this cost
successfully so far, but I will not defend my self-interest as a
“freedom” when there are people who have really lost their freedom for
this cause.</p>
