        <h2 class="center">The Shit of Freedom</h2>
        <p>Somebody once told me that freedom is one of these words you can’t
define without it becoming self-referential. A person will usually
start a sentence with “freedom is when you’re free to…” and their
minds will hesitate for a moment: a brief, unsettling glimpse at the
turtles that spiral all the way down. Few can stare into the abyss for
long, so they will quickly stumble back to the comfort of the known
and pick their favorite from a laundry list of personal wishes,
desires, and learned ideals, except perhaps if that person is an
academic, trained in words and systems of thought.  There’s probably
many valiant attempts at a definition out there, and I’m sure that on
this very day a Ph.D. student somewhere is doing a literature review
on freedom and is insanely bored with it.</p>

<p>It is like that with universal, deeply rooted, almost primal human
desires. It is like that with freedom. We think we know it when we
feel it, we sometimes know it when we see it in others, but the words
are hard to come by. We struggle to produce a concise definition; we
struggle with the very concept of it, and at some point in our lives
we wonder how free we really are, and what freedoms are perhaps worth
fighting for.  This, then, is the greater cost of freedom: its
pursuit. I guess what I’m saying, and I know this won’t please the
reader, is that our natural state of being, for most if not all of
human history, has been NOT free. It starts with family; then our
boss; the state; the market; even our partners and friends.</p>

<p>Yet, for all that socialization entails, for all the grooming into
conformity and compliance, for all the rules that we impose on
ourselves and others, we will rebel many times over. And every time
there will be a price to pay. Some will pay the ultimate price. My
friend Bassel, for example, he pursued freedom of information in a
land that couldn’t face itself, let alone a free spirit that soared
above its arid lands. Like Aaron Swartz, who pursued freedom of
information in a market that trades in commodities and not ideals;
like Chelsea Manning, who pursued freedom of information in a land
that associates freedom with weapons, war, and the power to abduct and
incarcerate. Like the founders of Pirate Bay, whose names I cannot
recount, but whose services I have often used for my teaching,
research, and entertainment; and like countless others, who will never
make headlines. It is a sign of our times, that some of us seek
freedom in information, and that some will pay an inordinately high
price for it. Our age is the information age. And we are not as free
as we think.</p>

<p>I could leave it at that. I meant to write a brief commentary on the
cost of freedom. It’s nothing special, but it’s kind of neatly wrapped
up there. However, I felt the need to say something more, something
more personal and probably more important. To say it out loud, and
ruffle some feathers: first my own, as I’m getting out of my comfort
zone here, then those of some prancing peacocks in the free culture /
FLOSS / digital rights scene, and the technopreneurs peddling freedom
for dollars and fame. You see, dear reader, there are other, hidden
costs to the whole endeavour of digital liberation… they’re
everywhere, inside and outside, in movements and in people, such as
disillusionment, waste, the cost of stupidity, as a friend put it. I
warn you now, this will get ugly. It needs to be. If you know me,
you’ll know I’m rather measured in my words and actions, even if not
docile. But here I won’t be. You’ll be offended. In fact, I hope you
will be. As much as I also seek the validation of others, I will now
pay the cost of expressing myself freely. With little inhibition.</p>

<p>And that is because, in many of my efforts to engage productively with
the project of digital liberation and assorted anxieties of our time,
there you were, my friend. The free software programmer that grossly
overstates their contribution; the free culture evangelist who’s in it
for personal gain and will happily privilege their culture over
everybody else’s; the opportunist entrepreneur and peddler of freedom
through code. You have spent a fair share of your life building
things. Building tools, networks and communities. Instigating projects
and influencing people, converting them to your cause, forging
friendships and partnerships; gathering resources to build the world
you desire. You are well educated, and you understand networks. In
short, you have super powers. You have gained the respect of many and
probably made some enemies along the way. You have a posse, your own
personal echo chamber. You come to events and gatherings filled with
the contagious energy that we all love you for. You speak of
awesomeness, projects, personal freedom, a friend in peril perhaps, a
worthy cause for all to rally around, a call from the White House, a
famous dissident, a Nobel Laureate, a Saudi prince. Networks of power,
culture and code. You gather resources. You make phone calls. You
entertain and motivate. You sound important. There is something about
you. In your presence, names drop like flies and jokes fly like
bullets. You’re awesome. And you’re so full of shit.</p>

<p>You’re always on the go. You forget things, you complicate things, you
exhaust yourself and others. You rarely forget to pack your ego,
though. Sometimes you manage to squeeze it all into your suitcase,
with a toothbrush, t-shirts, and chargers for your beloved
gadgets. But your ego is so large and overbearing, you couldn’t
possibly fit it in your luggage at all times. So you wear it on your
sleeve. You armour yourself with layer upon layer of ego steel. You
prance about, crack a joke, or two… or three… because you’re
awesome. You make a nice gesture, make a plan, and seek the admiration
of those around you more than anything else. You make more promises
than you’ll ever be able to keep. You make more plans than you will
ever follow up on. You make things fun. You make people believe in
themselves. You make them believe your shit. I think you believe it
too. I’m happy to know you. But you’re so full of shit.</p>

<p>So is your posse, that echo chamber you’ve built for yourself which
reinforces the best and the worst in you. Together you peddle freedom
to make money, to peddle more freedom, to make more money. Sound
familiar? Yeah, it’s what the US government does to the world.</p>

<p>What are the means and what is the end in what you do? I doubt you
know the answer. I only observe the briefest moments of reflection
from you and your buddies on what it is we’re doing here. Faint rays
of meaning in a cloud of technobabble, freedombabble and babble
babble.</p>

<p>You know I love you. You know I want to. I am charmed by your
presence, laugh at your jokes, and I have made some vaguely awesome
plans with you in the past. I too am a rather privileged white male
who enjoys the globetrotting lifestyle, the random jokes, the
occasional debauchery, the endless speculation over the next big
thing, the code that binds us all into one super-network of
super-friends. But knowing you a little too well, and being less
gullible than I once was, I can see right through your bullshit. And
there’s so much of it. Sometimes I know you’re trolling. Sometimes I
wish you were. Sometimes I think you’re just trolling yourself.</p>

<p>I have made mistakes in the past. I have missed deadlines. I have
failed to meet goals. I have disappointed others. But I am trying to
make peace with that. I try to speak less and listen more, focus on
what’s important, to be strong without being an ass, to be there for
others, as much as I also need others to be there for me. To respect
others, give them room to breathe, follow their lead when they know
best, lead them when they ask me to, work with them, not have them
work for me under false pretenses. Still, I fail often. Too often. I
am aware of that. Are you? And what do you do about it?</p>

<p>I’m not ashamed of my failings, not too much at least. Nor should you
be. I know you sometimes are. Is this why you never stop? Is this why
you’re always on the move and never ever shut up? Is this why you hate
stillness? Self-reflection is a downer, right? So is contemplating the
cost of freedom and the vapidness of so many of your projects. I know
the drill: invest in a huge number of things, because only one or two
in a thousand will succeed and make you somebody you so desire to
be. Of course, this only works if you can keep the cost ridiculously
low and make sure you contribute next to nothing to any single project
yourself. It’s all about long tails and downside risks and cheap
labor. I’ve read the blogs and talked to the people you talk to. I
probably read the books you didn’t, because you were too busy working
on your sales pitch, or curating your posse.</p>

<p>So there you are again, giving some of yourself so you can take much
more in return. Exploit the resources, the goodwill, the gullibility
and pain of others. Voluntary, cheap labor, free software, free
licenses, free content and free beer. Sometimes you’ll pay, sometimes
I’ll pay, but we gain nothing other than a few laughs and some
bruised, hypersensitive, needy egos. I have to wonder if you ever
built anything of note yourself. I can’t tell anymore what’s honest
about you and what’s dishonest. What’s real and what’s
pretence. You’ll find a cause that will serve your needs, you’ll grab
it and run with it to investors, conferences, seminars, workshops,
roundtables, parties, art galleries, hackerspaces, incubators…
anywhere you can sell the cause and find believers in something you
don’t believe in yourself.</p>

<p>Because if you did, you’d be fucking serious about it. You’d give up
that bullshit venture capitalist mentality that’s there to make money
for the few and feed your ego in the process. You’d see how it’s all
exploitative and stupid, and then you’d be truly embarrassed. Very
embarrassed. You would understand that when you ask me to join an
effort being made in the name of a cause I strongly believe in, and
then you make a mockery of that effort, I feel stupid for even
trying. And then I’m angry. So angry that I may say nothing, out of
respect for those around us who are truly trying to make something of
the moment, not only for themselves but also for others - like Bassel,
who has sacrificed so much for something he believed in, with nothing
in it for himself. Instead, I’ll pour my anger and disappointment
here. And my love. Because without love, I wouldn’t have cared to
write this. Without hope that you will read this and have a “FUCK ME!”
moment, I wouldn’t have bothered. Because you’re awesome. And you’re
so full of shit.</p>
