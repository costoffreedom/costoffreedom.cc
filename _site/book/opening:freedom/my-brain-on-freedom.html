        <h2 class="center">My Brain on Freedom</h2>
        <p>A cost of participation in free knowledge movements is “stupidity” – an assault
on intelligence, wisdom, reason, knowledge. The net effect of free knowledge on
intelligence is probably positive, possibly hugely positive if free knowledge
movements succeed in thoroughly commoning the noosphere, making collaboration
and inclusion the dominant paradigm for all economically valuable knowledge
production and distribution. But the stupidity costs of free knowledge are real
and painful, at least to me. Fortunately the costs, if acknowledged, can be
decreased, and doing so will increase the chances of achieving free knowledge
world liberation.</p>

<p>I want to explore briefly how individuals, communities, and society are
affected by various kinds of costs of free knowledge. This is going to be
cursory and incomplete. Very possibly also stupid: my mind has been infected by
free knowledge for about 25 years.</p>

<p>Commitment makes us morally stupid, lazy, and unconvincing. Claiming that
knowledge freedom is a moral issue is not a valid moral argument, but merely an
unsupported claim which ought be embarrassing if not immediately followed or
preceded by justification and more importantly, critique of said justification.
This is not to praise people who claim that freedom (or openness) is a matter
of efficiency rather than morality – they haven’t avoided making a moral claim.
Moral claims about freedom and efficiency as top values have been relentlessly
scrutinized by moral philosophers and social scientists. Still there is much
more to say. Free knowledge movements probably have much to contribute to the
discourse, but we have to stop being satisfied with straw man arguments and
propaganda, even while acknowledging that such have a place. Paths forward
include breaking down and scrutinizing “free as in freedom” from the
perspectives of various conceptions of freedom and other values and objectives
such as efficiency, equality, and security. Doing so will make you morally
smarter, more interesting, and make it more possible for people and movements
with non-freedom top goals or different conceptions of freedom to join in the
struggle for free knowledge.</p>

<p>Opportunity cost. Participating in free knowledge movements often entails
filling one’s brain with ridiculous trivia (e.g., about copyright), developing
one’s skills to workaround underdeveloped systems and institutions (e.g.,
administering one’s own server, [self-]publishing with little or no support for
financials, distribution, marketing), and self-exclusion from dominant venues
and tools. Each of these has a huge cost. You could be learning something
non-ridiculous, developing capabilities and competitive advantage rather than
engaging in a brutal exercise of de-specialization. One step forward is to
admit that these are huge costs, take them on carefully, and avoid criticizing
those who fail to fail to take them on, at least not without acknowledging that
they are costs rather than, or at least in addition to being moral imperatives.
Once admitted, free knowledge movement actors might prioritize reducing these
costs.</p>

<p>Scale. Free knowledge movements are often thought of as “bottom up” – see
phrases such as “many eyes make bugs shallow” and “democratized innovation”,
the idealization of DIY, decentralization, and contribution by individuals and
small non-profits; and suspicion of huge government and companies – at best
dominant institutions can be “hacked.” Now DIY and bottom up innovation and
small non-profits are vital and cool (well maybe small non-profits are only
vital) – but alone, they are dwarfish and stupid. Huge systems and
organizations are not only corrupt and unjust – they have huge economies of
scale, deep and specialized knowledge, and win markets and wars. Small scale
free knowledge actors are foragers who feel comfortable among their kin and
kindred, fearful of the farmers and their kings and armies – and are about to
(on the scale of human history) be driven to extinction. If freedom is
important, freedom movements abhorring large institutions is the ultimate
stupidity. The path forward is clear – the handful of already sizable free
knowledge organizations such as Wikimedia, Mozilla, and Red Hat must get much
larger, entrepreneurs (“social” or “for-profit”) attempting to create more free
knowledge “unicorns” (we can count consumer surplus and other social values in
the “billions” evaluation) encouraged, and sights set on taking the commanding
heights (e.g., mandating free knowledge through procurement and regulation)
rather than voluntary marginalization and hacks. One conception of a stupid
person or movement is one that consistently fails to meet its stated goals, or
consistently is outperformed by its competition, effectively taking two steps
back for every one forward, with bonus for failing to realize this is what is
happening. In this sense dwarfish free knowledge actors are stupid, and will
remain so til they crack the logic of collective action, mostly through huge
free knowledge institutions, though other improved coordination mechanisms may
help as well.</p>

<p>Diversity. Free knowledge movements aren’t very diverse, which contributes
mightily to the costs of joining and scaling, and thus intelligence, in
addition to missing out on intelligence benefits of diverse perspectives
documented elsewhere. Much has been written about lack of diversity in free
knowledge movements, and there is currently considerable effort by various
actors to increase diversity, so let me re-confirm my biases; that is, make
additional suggestions. Moral certainty is bad for diversity. It is repulsive
on its face, but also allows continuing failure to make free knowledge concerns
pertinent to more diverse groups. Huge opportunity costs make participation
feasible only for the relatively privileged, self-limiting diversity. Lack of
scale makes free knowledge movements insular and non-diverse. Like hanging out
with culturally similar committed free knowledge hacks? Great, you’re in the
right social club. Want world liberation? The cost in the short term might be
shedding some certainty, insularity, and fear, and thus feeling stupid. It’ll
make you, me, and free knowledge movements much smarter in the longer term.</p>

<p>Toxin. One topic endemic to most free knowledge movements is worth calling out
as an especially potent brain toxin: licenses. Yes they’re necessary for the
most part given bad default knowledge governance. But they make us stupid, over
and above knowledge of copyright, patent, and other regimes entailed.
Identities are wrapped up in particular license preferences. Consequential
claims of license effects are strenuously argued with zero evidence. No
worked-out model, no empirical evidence, whether from economics lab or natural
(possibly instigated) experiments. Anyone looking at these debates from the
outside (unfortunately almost nobody does so we’re spared the richly deserved
embarrassment) ought to laugh at the level of evidence freedom observed.
Emphasis on licenses is morally ruinous. Developers, authors, etc. are placed
in a privileged position: supposedly freedom is the right of all, but creator
choice is lionized. The consequences are terrible too: creator choice is a
recipe for dwarfism. Licenses are a distraction as well from public policy.
Acknowledging again that licenses are necessary, the step forward seems
obvious: re-conceptualize licenses away from vehicles of creator choice towards
prototypes for commons-favoring public policy. This exercise and actualization
will make free knowledge movement actors much smarter – we’ll have to engage
with the non-dwarfish implications of free knowledge and actually convince
people with other top policy concerns rather than hide from them.</p>

<p>One way to decrease the stupidity of free knowledge movements is more
cross-fertilization and knowledge and tool sharing across said movements.
Stupid-making knowledge acquisition about topics such as copyright and licenses
ought not need to be re-experienced in each free knowledge movement silo.
Intelligence-building comprehensive criticism also ought be shared across
silos. Breaking apart the silos would also increase diversity – each has a
different mix of participants, even if they are also almost all biased in some
of the same ways. While good for the whole, a warning to individuals:
attempting to learn about and cross-fertilize multiple free knowledge movements
might come at an extra high cost to your intelligence.</p>
