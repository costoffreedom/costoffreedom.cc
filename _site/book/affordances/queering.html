        <h2 class="center">Queering</h2>
        <p>From 23 to 24 May, <a href="http://femhack.org/">femhack</a> organized an international hackathon
in the loving memory of Sabeen Mahmud, getting together amongst a
large number of feminist hackerspaces locally and around the world.</p>

<p>Sabeen Mahmud was a Pakistani activist fighting for human rights in
Pakistan. She was the co-founder and director of the second floor
(T2F), a cafe in Karachi. She also had been the president of Karachi’s
branch of deTiE (The Indus Entrepreneurs), a not-for-profit
organisation dedicated to promoting entrepreneurial spirit. On 24
April 2014, she was shot down by unidentified gunmen while coming back
from the seminar she had just hosted at T2F, examining issues and
triggering awareness about people who had disappeared in Baluchistan,
a province of northern Pakistan.</p>

<p>A year after her death, we had the desire to express our solidarity
online and off-line, as a network of feminist spaces for resistance,
being transnationals and postcolonialists. Furthermore, this event
allowed us to more clearly define our network of solidarity. We do
have a shared discourse, and we also work to appropriate technological
space to the benefit of our communities. We feel we are engaged in a
larger process that fundamentally nurtures our small community-based
structures. Most of us consider we are in a sphere of action that
overcomes the deconstruction process needed to get out of a
proprietary way of life. We put forward alternative ways of life and
solidarity networks. Our next concern is to secure our existing
structures: this is not an easy process, as fragility is also a
definitive asset allowing for sensitivity and understanding.  However,
while numerous, our structures lack the sufficient visibility that
would allow better protection, and consequently it keeps being
difficult to identify everyone.</p>

<p>This day was the occasion of an encounter that has enabled us to
identify one another better: since then; we continue to exchange
messages on a dedicated mailing list that helps us to know each other
better. However, it still is very difficult to completely identify
each other in the varied materiality of our different
commitments. Since that day, the more than 30 structures in which we
are participating have developed a series of approaches to the issues,
going from Wikipedia editathons to augment feminist content on
Wikipedia, to Women in Surveillance meetups, citizen-sensing
endeavors, or small exchange and programming groups. However, despite
the persistent relations that we are creating and the commonality of
our interests and attitudes, it remains a complex challenge to
understand and assess the personality of each of us in an
always-transient state of being, as people are involved in projects
with different levels of risks.</p>

<p>All continents were represented during that event, but the most
numerous were situated in Latin America, maybe because of the beauty
of a language practice that has invented a written transgender form;
for example: “somos guapxs” is the transgender form of “we are
beautiful.”</p>
