        <blockquote>
  <p>The people who are in real danger never leave their countries. They are in danger for a reason and for that they don’t leave #Syria”</p>

  <p><a href="https://twitter.com/basselsafadi/status/164355948582932480">@basselsafadi</a> on Twitter, 1/31/2012 14:34:46, one month before detention.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In October 2010, I sat at a checkpoint on the Lebanon-Syria border,
waiting for Bassel. It was late, and I’d been sitting in a nearby
café, smelling of bleach but otherwise unremarkable, for nearly 12
hours. I was waiting with one of my traveling companions, Christopher
Adams, who had been denied entry as a result of visa issues
(“everything fine, stamps just changed yesterday”). We were part of a
group of Creative Commons advocates traveling to Damascus as the last
stop on a tour around the Arab world, doing workshops on free culture
and open source software, along with such community stalwarts as Joi
Ito, Lawrence Lessig, Mitchell Baker, Jon Phillips, and Bassel
himself. It was a group from the near-future, time traveling at a
second-per-second to the oldest still-inhabited city in existence, a
place outside of time.</p>

<p>It was clear, after much whispered negotiation between Bassel and the
border police, that Christopher wouldn’t be admitted via one of the
usual persuasions employed to skirt the bureaucratic impasses typical
for that part of the world. Bassel spent several hours on his cell
phone, serially calling government offices of murky authority, but
eventually it became apparent that a resolution required in-person
meetings. Bassel and the majority of our crew left for Damascus,
leaving Chris and me to enjoy the landscape, a sepia liminal space of
Martian desert and cinder-block buildings where used washing machines
and cell phones were sold. As the night wore on and nothing changed
Chris went back to Beirut, and I sat while Bassel allegedly made his
way back for me.</p>

<p>These moments didn’t stand out to me at the time, but it was here I
first was affected with great admiration and respect for Bassel
Khartabil, through watching his tireless commitment to his friends,
and later learning of his larger efforts enabling access to knowledge,
preserving cultural heritage, and fostering free creative
expression. The projects he’s created and supported, the artifacts
left behind, reveal an astonishing intuition for issues holding back
society in Syria and globally, and a singular vision for building
technical and social ways to address them. Organizing this trip to
Damascus for luminaries of the open culture/free software movement was
exemplary of what brings him joy: bringing his friends and colleagues
together, and sharing the knowledge and experience of his home.</p>

<p>Bassel Khartabil was born in Syria in 1981 of a Palestinian father and
Syrian mother. Although born in a culture known for its conservatism
and adherence to tradition, he was raised as the only child in a
liberal and creative household; his father, Jamil, a writer, and his
mother, Raya, a piano professor. As with many only-children, Bassel
was most at home inside his own curiosity and creativity. An avid
reader, he devoured advanced books on the ancient history of the
Middle East, and Greek mythology, from a young age. He was also a
natural self-learner and taught himself English from a CD-ROM on his
father’s computer. He was drawn to computers, helping his father
research online, and learning to program in C. This fascination and
facility with technology continued throughout his upbringing, fixing
his family computers, learning advanced programming for desktop and
the web, and joining the communities dedicated to advancing and
upholding the openness and creativity that he cherished. He was raised
in a place of rich history and tradition, but lives in a global world
of technology; a man outside of time.</p>

<p>Bassel, like many of us, found Freedom within technology, and tried to
share that freedom with others, but he did not yet know the cost.</p>

<p>If there is one thing always said about Bassel by the people that know
him best, it is that he loves to share is knowledge with anyone who
asks. For two weeks we lived out of <a href="https://wiki.hackerspaces.org/Aiki_lab">AikiLab</a>, the “hackerspace” he
founded in Damascus, giving workshops and lectures, and meeting the
young community that came to listen. The space was for more than just
events, it was a social gathering place, where knowledge was shared,
and new friends and collaborations made. Inside were computers,
projectors, the Internet, all of the equipment needed to provide
education and support to the nascent Syrian tech culture. But, the
vital element was not the gear or even AikiLab, but Bassel
himself. Even when he was confined in Adra prison, Bassel found time
to teach the other prisoners English and about technology, even though
they had no computers available.</p>

<p>But, even more than education, Bassel’s true gift is Protoculture,
developing the near-future alpha versions of projects catalyzing
change in cultural contexts, whether software tools, community
organization, or digital art. His <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aiki_Framework">Aiki</a> web development framework
allowed multiple developers to work simultaneously on a live web site,
while maintaining security. It was used to build still active open
content projects such as the <a href="https://openclipart.org/">Open Clip Art Library</a> and <a href="https://fontlibrary.org/">Open Font
Library</a>. His platforms, whether physical, social, or digital
enable new projects to spring up, and the community to build on its
self.</p>

<p>Perhaps none of Bassel’s cultural prototypes were more prescient than
the work he started around 2005, with a group of archeologists and 3D
artists, to virtually reconstruct the ancient ruins of Palmyra. One of
the world’s most important archaeological sites, Palmyra stood at the
crossroads of several civilizations, with Graeco-Roman architectural
styles melding with local traditions and Persian influences. Little
could Bassel know that ten years after he began, Daesh fundamentalists
would be actively deleting this architecture embodying Syrian, and the
world’s, cultural heritage. But his foray into digital archaeology and
preservation created a time capsule that will be invaluable to the
public, researchers, and artists for years to come.</p>

<p>Tragically, Bassel has not yet been able to complete this project. On
15 March 2012, Bassel was imprisoned by the Assad government in a wave
of arrests triggered by the civic unrest pushing for democratic
freedom in Syria. The United Nations Working Group on Arbitrary
Detention has determined that Bassel’s arrest and imprisonment were
arbitrary and in violation of international law, and has called for
his immediate release. For three years, he was held in the infamous
Adra prison with 7,000 others, until October 2015, when he was moved
to an unknown location. As of this writing, no information has been
released by the Assad government on his location or condition. The
<a href="http://freebassel.org/">#freebassel</a> campaign continues to fight to keep Bassel’s plight
in the public eye, and, ultimately, achieve his release. For Bassel,
the Cost of Freedom has not been trivial or abstract, but has caused
him to be separated from his community and loved ones.</p>

<p>We have recently launched a project building on Bassel’s original work
called <a href="http://newpalmyra.org/">#NEWPALMYRA</a>. It is an online community platform and data
repository dedicated to the capture, preservation, sharing, and
creative reuse of data about the ancient city of Palmyra. Released
under a Creative Commons CC0 license, all models and data collected
are available in the public domain to remix and distribute. The
project will continue, continued by its international affiliates and
advisors, until Bassel’s release, when he can accept his research
<a href="http://joi.ito.com/weblog/2015/10/22/mit-media-lab-r.html">position</a> at the MIT Media Lab and carry it forward once again.</p>

<p>The #NEWPALMYRA project starts from Bassel’s original vision, but goes
further, creating a new community around the virtual Palmyra through
open calls for participation, real world development events, and
pop-up art shows. A city is built in architecture, but lived in by
people, and our virtual New Palmyra will serve as a nexus for creative
explorations and cultural understanding. The book you are reading is
one of these related projects, bringing together writings from a
diverse and insightful group of authors committed to the promise of
free culture. Here we create our own time capsule, a record of
thoughts on freedom and responsibility from many different
perspectives and disciplines, so the next generation of digital
archaeologists can learn about us.</p>

<p>Eventually, Bassel came walking through the dark to that checkpoint,
and with more whispers to lackluster guards I was on my way to
Damascus. Christopher met our group the next day, and together we all
embraced Bassel’s world, one of standing up for freedom, and
constantly giving to his friends and community, that to this day
inspires us to push further. This Uncommon Creativity, an ability to
innovate and invent in the future while building on the past, is what
makes him a vital visionary for the Syrian community. But, I find
myself once again waiting for Bassel, this time to regain his Freedom
for which he has paid so dearly.</p>

<p>I hope, my friend, to see you soon.</p>
