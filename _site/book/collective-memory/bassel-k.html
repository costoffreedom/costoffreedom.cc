        <h2 class="center">"Bassel K"</h2>
        <p>I read <em>“The Trial”</em> at too young an age. It instilled in me many
things, some of them even positive, such as an affection for Franz
Kafka, an aspiration to taut structure, and a desire to tell
stories. It also haunted me, and it does to this day. It imprinted on
me an intense fear of undeserved imprisonment.</p>

<p>I was introduced to the imprisonment of Bassel Khartabil by three
remarkable people: Niki Korth, Jon Phillips, and Barry Threw. They are
in many admirable ways as free as Bassel is not. Each of the trio is
dedicated to their own individual and collective artistic pursuits to
explore the deep potential where technology and culture meet. They
make and celebrate the things that make today a special time.</p>

<p>And they know full well that all is not right in our time. They expend
significant energy in building awareness of the ongoing fact of
Bassel’s murky, tragic legal status. At their suggestion, back in
January 2014, I gathered musicians to highlight Bassel’s plight. These
musicians participate collectively in something called the Disquiet
Junto. It’s a freeform group I moderate that each Thursday responds to
music-composition prompts. The idea behind all the prompts is that
creative constraints, such as those employed in Oulipo and Fluxus, are
a useful springboard for creativity and productivity.</p>

<p>The Junto’s fondness for such “constraints” met a fierce complement
when we tackled Bassel’s situation, which is that of a most uncreative
form of constraint. There were many ways we could have paid tribute to
Bassel. What we elected to do in the Junto was to keep one of his
projects going: he may be in jail, but his art could continue to
develop. Prior to Bassel’s arrest on March 15, 2012, in Damascus, he
was working on several projects. Among them was a three-dimensional
computer rendering of the ancient city of Palmyra. What we in the
Junto did was make “fake field recordings,” audio of what the halls of
Palmyra’s structures might have sounded like millennia ago. Much as
Bassel was trying to revive an ancient world, the Junto participants
were, in essence, keeping one of his projects alive while he is
incapable of doing so. And, of course, building upon his artistic
efforts was true to the ethos of the Creative Commons, in which Bassel
has been profoundly engaged.</p>

<p>We had no idea, of course, back in early 2014, that Palymra would
itself receive worldwide attention when ISIS, the extremist movement,
would in 2015 move to destroy much of the ancient city’s remaining
architectural history, or that, later still, Russian warplanes would
further damage the site. This is one of Kafka’s lasting legacies: just
when things seem horrible, they can and do get worse.</p>

<p>Palmyra has fallen. Bassel remains in jail. The challenge to rectify
his situation has long since surpassed the overly employed term
“Kafkaesque.” Someone must have been telling lies about Bassel K,
because he is still kept from his freedom. But as long as he is in
prison, there are plenty of people telling his story, and keeping his
work alive.</p>
