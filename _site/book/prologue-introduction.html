        <h2 class="center">Introduction</h2>
        <p>Freedom comes with many costs, not least responsibility. Social,
psychological, financial, bodily, emotional: known and unknown costs,
often to bystanders, turn any strategy to gain and protect freedom
into an ambiguous quest. Sometimes it isn’t clear what freedom
means. Many people use and produce bits of free knowledge, but any
serious attempt quickly runs into tremendous barriers, in every
field. Participants receive unequal welcome due to gender, language,
cultural or economic differences. Occasionally, the production of
intangible assets may intersect with broader historical movements,
redefining their meanings and exposing their participants to unlimited
costs.</p>

<p>Considering the costs borne by millions to obtain, for example,
freedom from slavery or freedom to vote, free knowledge movements seem
rather safe and straightforward. By contrast, to consider the costs of
free culture, free software or open scientific research may look
adventurous, or perhaps just presumptuous. But this is what we will
attempt to do, with appropriate humility. This book wants to discuss
how free knowledge movements are built and the real costs attached to
them. Activists, artists, designers, developers, researchers, and
writers involved with free knowledge movements have worked together to
see further than the fog of our news feeds and produce some sense from
our different experiences.</p>

<p>This book is born in an attempt to free Bassel Khartabil Sadafi, loved
and celebrated Internet volunteer detained in Syria since 15 March
2012. His name has been deleted from the Adra Prison’s register where
he was detained, on 3 October 2015.  We have not received any
information about his current status or whereabouts since. The
introductory part of this book called <a href="./collective-memory/">Collective Memory</a> gives
voice to his friends and family that have been urging for his release
and want him back in his normal life and freedom, immediately.</p>

<p>Seeing Bassel paying a high price for his participation in free
culture, many of us have started to reflect on our own fates, actions,
and choices. Why are we here today? What have we chosen? What have we
given up in this process of sometimes extreme belief? The second part,
<a href="./opening:freedom/">OPENING: FREEDOM</a>, is a recollection of personal, sometimes
contradictory reflections and views about the experience of working
within free culture for some years. The diversity of contributions
express the many directions that have been taken to act.</p>

<p>The third part called <a href="./architectonics-of-power/">ARCHITECTONICS OF POWER</a> takes a step back
to look at how we, as a society, deal or fail to deal with the
different barriers that stand in our ways towards freedom. Different
authors analyze the contradictions of their choices and daily
activities with larger objectives and lifestyles associated with the
free culture. The variety of professions and situations of the
contributors offer an illustration stained with multiple tones.</p>

<p>Finally, the fourth part <a href="./affordances/">AFFORDANCES</a> offers a reflection on
theories and successful practices of free culture. It offers different
perspectives on the nature, structure, motivations and limitations of
existing levers towards liberation, not only legal and technological
but also social and cultural.</p>

<p>Once marginal, the free culture is today on the edge of becoming the
new normal thanks to the Internet while being threatened in its
fundamentals by its own success.  The many contributions in this book
offer a unique snapshot of its dreads and interrogations, and a
tentative program for the reader to reflect on the future of freedom
in our times.</p>
