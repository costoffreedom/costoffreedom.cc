        <p>We can say that a photographer owns her images, in the same way that
an author owns her words. (The shorthand for this ownership is
copyright.)</p>

<p>However, we should not conclude that the photographer has rights to
her subjects, legally or morally, in the same way that an author has
rights to her ideas. The reason that a photographer cannot make claims
upon her subjects is that her work crosses that boundary between
persons, and persons have their own rights which must be considered.</p>

<p>We are not so ignorant as to say that a photograph will steal our
soul, and yet we are dimly aware of a danger in pictures of our faces
or bodies, as if something can be taken from us, and get away, to who
knows what end. We know there could be a “cost” to each photograph
that is taken.</p>

<p>Photography did not always enjoy the protections of copyright. The
argument went that manipulating a machine (in this case, a camera),
did not count as a creative act.</p>

<p>Eventually, the question of whether making a photograph rose to the
level of authorship was settled by the courts, in the
affirmative. Photographers are the authors of their creations and thus
own the copyright.</p>

<p>That photographs are protected by copyright also means that a
photographer is free to release her work under a free license that
allows others to use, reproduce, modify, and learn from her
creations. The minimal requirement to re-use a freely licensed
photograph is the simple gesture of giving credit or attribution to
the photographer, in the manner she specifies.</p>

<p>Free licenses apply to a photographer’s rights as an author, and your
rights as a user. However, they are silent on the legal and moral
rights of the subjects of our photographs, which we might understand
as the right of publicity.</p>

<p>In order to secure this additional right, the photographer must ask
something of her subject.</p>

<p>The subject must consent not only to the photographer’s use of his
image, and to others’ re-use and modifications of his image; he must
also permit his name and identity to be associated with his
image. That is the “cost” of the “freedom” of his picture. He lets a
fragment of his soul escape out into the world, forever.</p>
