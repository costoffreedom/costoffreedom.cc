        <h2 class="center">Why I Refused My Proprietary Self</h2>
        <p><em>Edited by hellekin, 3 Nov 2015, Pourrières, France.</em></p>

<p>I find myself, after all this time immersed in free culture, amazed at
my holding on to some form of the proprietary way of
thinking. Sometimes I have found myself consciously going quite a long
way down that path before I stop myself and almost forceably ask
myself “hey! What are you doing?”</p>

<p>Some time ago I started a methodology called the Book Sprint. It’s a
way to facilitate the production of books in 3-5 days with a group of
6-12 people (or so). It took a long time to hammer out this
method. Much financial, personal, and emotional pain to keep going
down a road that nobody, including myself, really understood terribly
well. Was it really possible to make it work? Well, it took about 4
years of hammering on this methodology, making plenty of mistakes,
before I could actually think about it as a methodology. Before I
could actually wield it with some form of embryonic artistry, see it
in action, build upon it, improve it, teach it to others.</p>

<p>4 years is a long time. It felt like a long time. Truth is, I don’t
really know why I didn’t give up, and my stubbornness is something
that kind of shocks me, looking back.</p>

<p>Suddenly I could see the prospect of a sustainable lifestyle
emerging. How would I make it happen and protect it? I had this
horrible feeling that I was not good enough at scaling the project and
some big ugly org with heaps of cash would scoop in and ‘steal it’. I
guess I meant they would swoop in and copy it. The danger of a
ripped-off dream caught me off-guard and I went down the road of
lawyers and trade mark protection for Book Sprints. This was my first
step towards owning the methodology.</p>

<p>I look back at that now and I’m kind of amazed I went down that path
as far as I did. I didn’t actually follow through with
trade-marking. The lawyer told me it was going to cost more and more,
and it gave me time to wake myself up. What was I doing? The fear of
losing my creation led me down a blinkered “IP” way out of line with
my personal politics. It brought me awareness to peel off the layers
of proprietary living that transpires our skins.</p>

<p>The process is a process of painful personal growth. Sharing my
experience with hardened free culture practitioners, I’ve met quick
nods of agreement. Only the idealist newcomers look puzzled at my
apparent failure: I’m not a true believer. There is no purity on the
path to freedom. Walking through the shameful path of not meeting the
high bar we’ve set ourselves to avoid proprietary life, I keep
learning about how deeply embedded it is in our daily lives. I keep
examining it and it keeps surprising me. I keep discarding it. There’s
still a long way to go.</p>
