                    The Cost of Freedom is a book that will be written in Marseille from November 2nd to 6th. We are looking for activists, artists, designers, developers, researchers, and writers involved with free knowledge movements <small>( open access / culture / data / education / government / hardware / science / software / wiki )</small> to join the effort and take part in this Book Sprint.

                <p>Freedom comes with many costs, not least responsibility. Social, psychological, financial, bodily, emotional : known and unknown costs, often to bystanders, turn any strategy to gain and protect freedom into an ambiguous quest. Sometimes because it isn't clear what freedom means.</p>

                <p>Considering the costs borne by millions to obtain, for example freedom from slavery or freedom to vote, free knowledge movements seem rather safe and straightforward. By contrast, to consider the costs of free culture, free software or open scientific research may look adventurous, or perhaps just presumptuous. But this is what we will attempt to do, with appropriate humility.
                </p>

                <p>Many people use and produce bits of free knowledge but any serious attempt quickly runs into tremendous barriers, in every field. Participants receive unequal welcome due to gender, language, cultural or economic differences. Occasionally, the production of intangible assets may intersects with broader historical movements, redefining their meanings and exposing their participants to unlimited costs.</p>

                <p><strong>During intense 5 days, a group of 10-12 people will gather in Marseille to discuss how free knowledge movements are built and what are the real costs attached to them. We will work together to see further than the fog of our news feeds and produce some sense by using the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Book_sprint" title="Book Sprint Wikipedia page">Book Sprint</a> methodology created by Adam Hyde.</strong>
                </p>
                <p>We are also inviting remote contribution of mini-essays on the topic. You are encouraged to contribute. Essays must be received by the <s>end of November 3 UTC</s><b>Thursday, Nov 5 at 11:00 UTC (Paris: noon; New York: 6AM; Tokyo: 9PM)</b> to be included in the book.</p>

                <blockquote>
                <small>
                <p>We’re asking people like yourself who have been fighting in the trenches of various free knowledge movements (culture, software, science, etc.) to contribute brief essays for inclusion in the book. One form an essay might take is a paragraph on each of:</p>

                <ul>
                <li>An issue you’ve faced that was challenging to you in your free knowledge work, through the lens on "cost"; perhaps a career or time opportunity cost, or the cost of dealing with unwelcoming or worse participants, or the cost of "peeling off layer upon layer the proprietary way of life" as put in <a href="http://www.adamhyde.net/open-is-not-a-license/">www.adamhyde.net/open-is-not-a-license/</a></li>
                <li>How you addressed this challenge, or perhaps have yet to do so completely</li>
                <li>Advice to someone starting out in free knowledge; perhaps along the lines of had you understood the costs, what would you have done differently</li>
                </ul>

                <p>But feel free to be maximally creative within the theme. We don’t have a minimum or a maximum required length for contributed essays, but especially do not be shy about concision or form. If all we get is haiku that might be a problem, or there might be a message in that of some sort.</p>

                <p>Other details: The book will be PUBLISHED on Nov 6. We need your contribution no later than <strong>Thursday, Nov 5 at 11:00 UTC (Paris: noon; New York: 6AM; Tokyo: 9PM)</strong> to be included. The book will be released under CC0; giving up the “right” to sue anyone for any use whatsoever of your contribution is a cost of entry... or one of those proprietary layers to be peeled back.
