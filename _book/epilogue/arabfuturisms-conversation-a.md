<div class="offset-by-one columns"><p>“In hypernational ecstasy-”</p></div>

“What about starting with where it’s come from, something like that? -”

<div class="offset-by-one columns"><p>“-But they’ve called it a swarm, an influx-”</p></div>

“There is something happening in Europe.”

<div class="offset-by-one columns"><p>“We are distinctly distant from the mythologies of nationhood and home-”</p></div>

“Stand up and step back.”

“-What do we have”

<div class="offset-by-one columns"><p>“-The nation is dead, it is a citadel of illusion that has collapsed; pour me a drink and let us drink of its ruins. -”</p></div>

“The nation is dead-”

<div class="offset-by-one columns"><p>“-Arabfuturism exponentially expands on discourse surrounding -”</p></div>

<div class="offset-by-one columns"><p>“-Arabfuturism is accelerating the transformation of representation; beyond the logic of the state.”</p></div>

<div class="offset-by-one columns"><p>“-Surrounding the policing, observation and censoring of brown minds-”</p></div>

<div class="offset-by-one columns"><p>“-...Indefinable in the emergence of an autonomous hybrid sedimentation of identities that is dismantling the boundaries and expanding the borderzones between constructs of culture and civilisation that have assembled a contrived European identity in opposition to an historic Other.”</p></div>

“Punctuation-,”

“Something about re-examining history?”

<div class="offset-by-one columns"><p>“-Arabfuturism is a re-examination and interrogation of narratives that surround oceans of historical fiction. It bulldozes cultural nostalgias that prop up a dubious political paralysis and works to solidify and progress a progressive force, towards being subjects and not objects of history”</p></div>

“-History?”

<div class="offset-by-one columns"><p>“histories-”</p></div>

<div class="offset-by-one columns"><p>“If the ultimate hegemonic power is the power to define and not the power to conquer; the map, the straight line, legitimacy and authenticity are questions that flutter between the virtualities and actualities of adopted identities.”</p></div>

<div class="offset-by-one columns"><p>“What are we proposing?”</p></div>

<div class="offset-by-one columns"><p>“Arabfuturism is an impetus that seeks to accelerate the annihilation of the ideological apartheidic walls, whose delusional hallucinations make us cower in fear at the deafening loudness of our indifference;  whilst we dance to the silence of our differences.”</p></div>

“A continuous motion”

<div class="offset-by-one columns"><p>“Accelerate-”</p></div>

“-Accelerating-”

<div class="offset-by-one columns"><p>“- delusional hallucinations make us cower in fear at the deafening loudness of our indifference (whilst we dance to the silence of our differences.)”</p></div>

“But there is something happening in Europe,-”

<div class="offset-by-one columns"><p>“Arabfuturism conceives instead, an origin in imagined space, towards the abyss of an imagined future”</p></div>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“-Dancing on the ruins of the post-orientalist stage; in the desert of the unreal; high on the opulence of emptiness.”

<div class="offset-by-one columns"><p>“- Violent births of countries; the expansions and contractions, the demise and deaths, -”</p></div>

<div class="offset-by-one columns"><p>“-the demise and deaths of nations.”</p></div>

“The nation is dead-”

“-Something is happening in Europe-”

“-It is a citadel of illusion that has collapsed.”

“-The internet as a public square,-”

“Arabfuturism celebrates the temporalities of our collaborative genealogies-”

“Mourning-”
 
<div class="offset-by-one columns"><p>“Present tense. Mourns the immortality of our insular mythologies of selfhood.”</p></div>

<div class="offset-by-one columns"><p>“-an emergent cultural aesthetic; accelerating the transformation of representation;-”</p></div>

“-beyond the logic of the state.”
