_This book was written in Pourrières, France, in five days, from 2nd
to 6th November 2015._

Just two weeks before, I got a phone call from a friend, asking me to
help bring attention to the plight of Bassel Khartabil, by organizing
this book. We jumped into the project instantly, starting to pull
people together, authoring web pages and open calls, sending emails
and calling everyone we could think of.

The book you are reading is the result of this emergent process, based
on friendship, internal networks, and external publications.

It originates with our friend Bassel, suffering in a Syrian jail that
has taken him away from us. I have never met him, but I am calling him
a friend because I know from all who have known him that I will have a
good time meeting, talking, and working with him.

In the small group of "free culture," we tend to regard each other as
friends. We all feel committed to a common mission. For this book, we
made an open call to those who have "been in the trenches of free
culture". That sounds like an overstatement for most of us who are not
in jail but are instead mostly writing, coding and taking part in
interesting projects, enjoying our freedom.

Thus, when we call for a reflection on "the Cost of Freedom," we
suddenly appeal not to our group and our mission, but to each
individual that has been part of it. Instead of preaching the values
of a whole system supposedly based on commons and sharing, we target
people in their daily lives - those who have suffered from loneliness,
questioning, bankruptcy, burnout, exploitation, and even from seeing
friends and partners suddenly missing, just for having been a part of
free culture.

This book is not a statement about freedom and culture; it is a primal
scream, the sum of our questions and desires. It is the raw expression
of our lives. It talks about what is ultimately made through the dream
of free culture: us.

This book is dedicated to Bassel Khartabil Sadafi and to all those
that will recognize themselves in the stories told in these pages.
