> After looking at "Open is not a License", I decided to take a look
  at some of the definitions of the noun "open" in the dictionary, and
  was inspired to write a short poem around what "open" might mean to
  people.
> This poem is dedicated to my own poetry inspiration, my father Don
  Goodman, who passed away in March 2015 at the age of 75.

What is open?
<br>Is it a gap or a space?
<br>Is it something in public?
<br>Or a practice we chase?

Open is unenclosed
<br>It is an expanse
<br>Did we get here by planning?
<br>Or merely by chance?

Open is an opportunity
<br>A chance to broaden the mind
<br>Free tools and resources
<br>To benefit all of mankind

Open is an aperture
<br>Something you look through
<br>Access for all
<br>Not just the few

Open is a cavern
<br>A vast empty space
<br>A new way of working
<br>Falling into place

Open is a competition
<br>That anyone can enter
<br>A growing global movement
<br>With sharing at its centre
